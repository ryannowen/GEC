# GEC
Game Engine Construction ICA 2 (97% - A)

This project was created for my GEC module, using HAPI and C++ to create a game engine. HAPI is the bare bones of a Library,
in which it only creates the game window, and Loads/Plays sounds, everything else had to be implemented myself e.g Rendering, World,
Collisions, AI, etc.

The Game demo is Possession, a simple verus game in which there is a main character, that must kill 3 bosses to win, however the other
player must place and possess enemies to kill the main character, if successful the players will switch. Whoever kills the final boss
as the main character wins.
